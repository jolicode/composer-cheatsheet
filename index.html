These allow you to further restrict or expand the stability of a package beyond the scope of the <a href=\"http://getcomposer.org/doc/#minimum-stability\">minimum-stability</a> setting. You can apply them to a constraint, or just apply them to an empty constraint if you want to allow unstable packages of a dependency's dependency for example.<br /><code>require</code> and <code>require-dev</code> additionally support explicit references (i.e. commit) for dev versions to make sure they are blocked to a given state, even when you run update. These only work if you explicitly require a dev version and append the reference with <code>#&lt;ref&gt;</code>.",

This is even true if a different version of a package would be installable and solve the conflict. The reason is that <code>install --dev</code> produces the exact same state as just <code>install</code>, apart from the additional dev packages.<br />If you run into such a conflict, you can specify the conflicting package in the require section and require the right version number to resolve the conflict.",

This allows you to fork a package, publish it under a different name with its own version numbers, while packages requiring the original package continue to work with your fork because it replaces the original package.<br /><br />This is also useful for packages that contain sub-packages, for example the main symfony/symfony package contains all the Symfony Components which are also available as individual packages. If you require the main package it will automatically fulfill any requirement of one of the individual components, since it replaces them.<br /><br />Caution is advised when using replace for the sub-package purpose explained above. You should then typically only replace using <code>self.version</code> as a version constraint, to make sure the main package only replaces the sub-packages of that exact version, and not any other version, which would be incorrect.",

PSR-0 is the recommended way though since it offers greater flexibility (no need to regenerate the autoloader when you add classes).<br /><br />Under the <code>psr-0</code> key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root.

There are individual packages for the components. The Yaml component is under <code>Symfony\\Component\\Yaml</code>. The package root is that Yaml directory. To make autoloading possible, we need to make sure that it is not installed into <code>vendor/symfony/yaml</code>, but instead into <code>vendor/symfony/yaml/Symfony/Component/Yaml</code>, so that the autoloader can load it from <code>vendor/symfony/yaml</code>.",

This defaults to <code>stable</code>, so if you rely on a <code>dev</code> package, you should specify it in your file to avoid surprises.<br />All versions of each package are checked for stability, and those that are less stable than the <code>minimum-stability</code> setting will be ignored when resolving your project dependencies. Specific changes to the stability requirements of a given package can be done in <code>require</code> or <code>require-dev</code>.Available options are <code>dev</code>, <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, <code>RC</code>, and <code>stable</code>.",

To reference a <code>composer</code> repository, just supply the path before the <code>packages.json</code> file. In case of packagist, that file is located at <code>/packages.json</code>, so the URL of the repository would be <code>packagist.org</code>.

Again, the minimum required fields are <code>name</code>, <code>version</code>, and either of <code>dist</code> or <code>source</code>.<br/>See the <a href=\"http://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#package\">full documentation</a>.",
